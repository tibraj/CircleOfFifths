- The circle of fifths is a visual tool that organizes the twelve chromatic pitches in a sequence of perfect
fifths.
- It can represent notes, chords and keys inherent to a pitch.

- It can also be used as a compositional tool.
- The circle of fifths helps determine the fifth in a chord. (Ab C Eb G)
- The circle of fifths helps determine the root and dominant chord in a particular key. (Bb F)
- The circle of fifths is useful for identifying accidentials.
- Following the circle clockwise increments each note's key by a sharp.
- Following the circle counter-clockwise increments each note's key by a flat.

- It can also be used as a compositional tool.
- The circle of fifths is useful for identifying similarities.
- An alternate ring lists each key's relative minors that share the same notes.
- In tandem with the major ring, a more nuanced key map appears allowing for transitional key changes.
